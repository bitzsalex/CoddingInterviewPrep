## Repo Description
----
  
First, thanks to my friend Fithalew Ashagre for pointing me the [Daily Coding Problem site](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com) to practice coding interview questions every single day for free.  

This repository is a place where I can store all my solutions to the questions.
  
  
### Folder Structure
----
  
Because I want this repository to not to just story my solutions but to track my daily strikes, I structured the folders as follows.
  
Problems
|-- Day#[Number_of_day] [Difficulty_level]
    |-- description.md
    |-- solution.py
  
By the time I start this challenge, I used only `Python` just to keep going. I will try to add other languages solutions when I feel comfortable and dedicated for the challenge.  
When other languages get added they will have their own solution file like: `solution.java` for java language, `solution.cpp` for C++ and so on.
